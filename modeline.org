* TODO modeline customization
  I was using doom-modeline but thought that I should probably make my own. I would like certain things:
** custom buttons per buffer
   + in cider-repl-mode I would like buttons to
     + cider-repl-clear-buffer
   + in clojure-mode
     + cider-load-file
     + set-ns
     + 


   could do that with a minor mode??

** flycheck
   doom-modeline has out of the box support for flycheck.. should add something like this as well
   reading:

   aha! in the minor mode i can see the flycheck status
   had to disable minions mode

** minor modes stuff
   speaking of flycheck, have to deal with minor modes in a way

   I can customize the minions to enable certain minor modes to display directly
   + (defcustom minions-direct nil
  "List of minor-modes that are shown directly in the mode line."

     #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(use-package minions
  :demand t
  :config
  (minions-mode 1)
  (add-to-list 'minions-direct 'flycheck-mode) ;; enabling flycheck-mode to be displayed
  (setq doom-modeline-minor-modes (featurep 'minions)))
     #+END_SRC

** narrow/widen
   If I have narrowed down to something i should display a clickable icon. when clicked it should widen
